# Joblab test

Welcome to the Joblab test and thanks for applying for this role!


Here we have a scenario similar to the work we do at Joblab.

### Scenario

Given we have Applicants and Employers, when one employer creates a new Vacancy,
we would like to email matching candidates based on location.

The email will have two links:
- interested
- not interested

We want to keep track of the Applicants `interested` / `not interested` in the role. 

### Notes

- keep `matching algorithm` simple
- same with email template
- app does not need to send `real` emails


### Submission

Clone this repository, write your solution and update the README with decisions 
made during development time and if you have any thoughts on how to continue 
building the app.

When you have everything ready, send us a `zip` file to:

`developer`@`joblab.com`

In case you have any doubt, feel free to send an email to discuss the issue.

Happy coding!
